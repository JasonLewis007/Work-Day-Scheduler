# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
I was given existing code to create a simple work day schedler app that is able to save user info to local storage.  
The app updates hourly to show past, present and current hours.  When the app is opened by the user, the current day is 
displayed at the top of the app.  The timeblocks are displayed in standard business hours and are colored coded to represent past, present, and future timeblocks.  The user is able to click on timeblock and input events.  Once the events are entered, the user can press the save icon to save the event to local storage.
